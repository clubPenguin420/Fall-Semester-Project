# Calculator
 An expression based calculator that intakes an expression and outputs the result
 
## Things I want to add
 - Evaluate expressions with all the common arithmitic operators
 - Include support for various functions like trig functions
 - Possibly add support for variables and custom functions(honestly at this point I might as well make a scripting language)
