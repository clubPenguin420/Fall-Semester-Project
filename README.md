# Calculator
 An expression based calculator that intakes an expression and outputs the result
 For now it can:
- Evaluate expressions with all the common arithmetic operators
- Include support for various functions like trig functions and logarithms 
- You can assign values to variables
 
## Things I want to add

 - Possibly add support for custom functions
 - Complex numbers
 - Equation solver
 
# Usage
 If you just want to run it off the bat, go to the most recent release and download the .jar. Then open cmd in the directory where the jar was downloaded and type:
 `java -jar [name].jar`
 
 If you want to build it from the source, then download the source code and open cmd in the directory where pom.xml is: `mvn install`
 
 If you don't have Maven installed, here's what you do:
 - First go to https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi and download the [name]-bin.zip
 - Then you extract the contents to a place in your computer
 - Next, you copy the address of the bin folder and save it to the PATH variable
 - Type `mvn -v` in cmd to verify your install
